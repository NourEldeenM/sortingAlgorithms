# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection sort

1. Array is imaginary divided into 2 parts (sorted & unsorted).
2. Sorted part is empty and unsorted one has the whole array.
3. In every step, find the minimum or maximum element in the unsorted part and add it to the end of sorted one.
4. When unsorted part becomes empty, the algorithm stops.

## Insertion sort

1. Array is imaginary divided into 2 parts (sorted & unsorted) just as selection sort.
2. sorted part contains the first element in the array, & unsorted has the rest of the array.
3. In every step, the algorithm takes the first element in the unsorted part then <bold>Inserts</bold> it in its right place in sorted part (by shifting elements to assure it's put in its right place).
4. Algorithm ends when unsorted part is empty.

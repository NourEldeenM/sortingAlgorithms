# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection sort

1. Array is imaginary divided into 2 parts (sorted & unsorted).
2. Sorted part is empty and unsorted one has the whole array.
3. In every step, find the minimum or maximum element in the unsorted part and add it to the end of sorted one.
4. When unsorted part becomes empty, the algorithm stops.
